# User Interface
Through out the overview documentation we talk about the fact that CodeFactory is integrated into the target IDE where the product is used. This design approach allows us to maximize the capabilities of delivery automation. 
Each user interface environent for CodeFactory will be based on the target IDE in which it supports. 
This is the one part of CodeFactory that many not be reusable across different IDE's.

# User Interface for Visual Studio
CodeFactory out of the box has native dialog window support for Visual Studio. 
The user interface environment is based on Windows Presentation Foundation or (WPF). 
This is the native UI framework that is supported by Visual Studio.

CodeFactory user interface control is designed to plug directly into a Visual Studio window. The CodeFactory control provides minor extensions to the existing user control object that is part of WPF. 
Any developer that is familar with XAML based user screens will be able to easily author and creator a dialog window to be displayed in Visual Studio.
