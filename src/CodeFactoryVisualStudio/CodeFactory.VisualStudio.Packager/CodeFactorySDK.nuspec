      SDK Update for CodeFactory 1.22305.1
      
      This release of the SDK focuses on the following.
	  - Have updated the injection process of code into files. You no longer have to provide the file path, framework determines this.
      - Have added an overload to AddBeforeAsync functionality to allow you to add directly before the definition of the model ignoring xml documentation.
      - LookupModel is now obsolete use GetModel now.
	  - Added GetModel[T] this allows to set the target type to return instead of having to cast to directly.
	  - CodeFactory.Formatting.CSharp has been moved into the SDK.
	  - NamespaceManager in formatting now supports adding additional using statements after the manager has been loaded.
	  - CsManualUsingStatement has been added to formatting to allow adding customizing using statements to the namespace manager.
      - Can now directly control code documentation from the SDK. Added the following code management methods to control documentation.
        - AddBeforeDocsAsync - Add source code content before XML documentation.
        - AddAfterDocsAsync - Add source code content after XML documentation.
        - ReplaceDocsAsync - Replaces the XML documentation.
        - DeleteDocsAsync - Deletes the XML documentation.
      - CsProperty mode has added the following capabilities.
	    - GetMethod property has been added to give you direct access to the get accessor and all the code management functions of the method.
        - SetMethod property has been added to give you direct access to the set accessor and all the code management functions of the method.
      - CsEnum mode has added the  the following capabilities
        - Can now inject code at the beginning of the Enum body.
        - Can now inject code at the end of the Enum body.
        - Can now get the source location of the contents of the Enum body.
      - CsContainer Types (Class,Interface, Structure) now support nested type definitions, this includes the following.
        - Class,Interface, Structure, and Enums can be nested in the above container types.
      - CSMethod now provide partial support in definition which includes the following.
        - Method Partial Definition - The capture of the definition of a partial method.
        - Method Partial Implementation - The capture of the implementation of a partial method.
        - When getting the list of methods you will get two instance models now. One for the definition and second for the implementation. 
        - CsMethodType has added two additional enums PartialDefinition and PartialImplementation.
      - XML Documentation for all models is directly captured from source code so the raw documentation is provided. This includes the following.
        - Partial implementations will provide the target xml documentation that was provided. 
	      If documentation was provided in each partial file it will grab the target file the model generation was requested from.
      - All C# Models now have a ModelSourceFile property that identifies the source code file the model was generated from.
      - Fixed an issue with the Visual Studio packager not able to process project paths that had spaces in the path.
