# CodeFactoryâ„¢

# What is CodeFactory?

CodeFactory is real time software delivery tool that natively runs inside of Visual Studio. The focus of CodeFactory is to increase the delivery velocity of building new applications or the uplift/refactor of projects to other technologies.

## Automation of Construction Delivery Patterns
One of the core features of CodeFactory is to use your application source code as a data model.  This is a similar concept to ORM mapping based tools. 

This allows for the implementation of development patterns which can then auto generate common application code that developers would otherwise have to build by hand. The following common usage scenarios showcase this concept.  These are by no means the only scenarios in available.

- Adding/Creating Bounds checking in methods
- Implementation of exception handling logic
- Implementation of standard logging
- Automation of dependency injection
- Auto creation of different application layers based on common data models that can now be identified directly from application source code
- Auto generation of data access layers based on different technologies that fit the need of a target delivery pattern
- Auto generation of validation logic based on application source code data
- Auto generation and mapping of logic between service technolgoies and consumers

## Automation of Technology Transformation
Due to the way in which the CodeFactory SDK was designed - the tooling is very helpful in transforming existing functionality of an application to a new technology implementation. The following are common usage scenarios for technology transformation - but like the Construction Patterns above are not the only scenarios for usage.

- Read ORM based data classes and transform into POCO's or to other ORM based implementations
- Read data classes and generate interface definitions for all classes
- Read markup languages and use adapters to transform markup from one implementation into another (Example WebForms to Blazor)
- Read markup languages and update UI implmentation frameworks from one implementation to another (Example Modern UI to BootStrap)
- Lift and shift of application logic from one platform to another (Example map logic from .net framework to .net standard)
- Migration Mapping of logic from one system to another (Example using UI dialogs to select where logic comes from and where it goes in a new system)

## Designed for Different Delivery Approaches
CodeFactory directly integrates into the Solution Explorer in Visual Studio. This provides flexibility to the delivery team on when to use automation and how that automation should be triggered. The following are a few examples, much like the others above these are not the only approaches that can be taken.

### Contract Driven Approach
Interfaces are defined and automation triggers when interfaces need to be implemented. Allowing for a interface based design of the system and the core shell of the entire delivery driven by interface implementations.

### UI Driven Approach
User Interface dialogs are defined and triggered as a part of an automation command and questions are asked which generates the impementation of new or uplift of application logic. 

### Event Driven Approach
Changes in markup files or .net application code files like c# will trigger the option to execute automation logic to complete the implementation of logic. 

### Rebuild Approach
Logic is run that will rebuild the definition of a target artifact. This is a common approach with ORM based tools.

### Hybrid Approach
This is the most common which uses a number of the above approaches together to meet a development teams delivery needs. 

## Zero Touch Delivery Tool
CodeFactory runs inside of visual studio itself and it acts more like a behind the scenes compiler.  CodeFactory is a design time tool and has no application runtime capabilties. This means there is no application libraries or technologies that have to be included inside the application you are delivering. Any artificates that are generated by CodeFactory appear to be standard developer hand written code. 

## Designed to Build Team Customized Delivery
CodeFactory is a team delivery tool, which means there is no one size fits all delivery process. Its a SDK style platform that simplifies the design of automation to be taken advantage of by delivery teams. 
CodeFactory releases a standard set of automation libraries fully implemented. 
The goal of these libraries is to provide standard guidance scenarios. 
Alot of teams will want to extend and change the guidance. Which is exactly what this tool is designed for.

The following are the core capabilities of CodeFactory

### Solution and Project Management
Direct access to the solution and project system hosted inside of visual studio. This will include access and partial management of the following items.

- Solution
- Solution Folders
- Projects
- Project Folders
- Project Documents
- C# Source Code Files

### Document Management
Direct access to any document that is hosted in the solution this will include the following.

 - Read of all content from any document in the solution
 - Replace all content in a document
 - Add/remove/replace content at target locations within the document
 - Add new documents
 - Remove documents
 
### C# Source Code Model Generation
CodeFactory builds real time data models of C# code files. The models provide access to the following information

 - Using statements
 - Namespace definitions
 - Attributes
 - Classes
 - Interfaces
 - Structures
 - Delegates
 - Fields
 - Methods
 - Properties
 - Events
 - Type definitions
 - Access to the body of classes, interfaces, structures
 - Access to the body of methods, properties, events
 - Source code management that include replace, add before, add after, delete on all member objects
 - Source code management that include replace, add before, add after, delete, beginning, end of all classes,structures, interfaces

### Source Formatting
CodeFactory provides support for formatting of source code regardless of target langauges. This includes the following

 - T4 integration to support the use of T4 formatting files to emite the target source code to be generated
 - Source formatter an internal code factory formatter that provides granular source editing

### User Interface Management
CodeFactory integrates natively into the Visual Studio IDE. Allowing people to build their own custom dialog windows that display as native windows inside of visual studio.


## Build Using .Net Technologies for Fast Adoption
CodeFactory was designed to author automation using the C# programing language. All of code factory technologies are written using .net framework libraries.

(Note: This is a current limitation of the Visual Studio development environment. As Microsoft provide .net core integration into visual studio code factory will update at that time)

CodeFactories SDK provides a common set of tools for delivery teams to quickly extend and author their own automation for application delivery.
